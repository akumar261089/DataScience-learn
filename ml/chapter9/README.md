  # Example sequence data (sin wave)
  import numpy as np
  timesteps = np.linspace(0, 100, 1000)
  data = np.sin(timesteps)

  # Prepare data
  def create_inout_sequences(input_data, tw):
      inout_seq = []
      L = len(input_data)
      for i in range(L-tw):
          train_seq = input_data[i:i+tw]
          train_label = input_data[i+tw:i+tw+1]
          inout_seq.append((train_seq, train_label))
      return np.array(inout_seq)

  seq_length = 10
  data_inout = create_inout_sequences(data, seq_length)
  x = torch.tensor(data_inout[:, 0]).float().unsqueeze(-1)
  y = torch.tensor(data_inout[:, 1]).float().unsqueeze(-1)

  ```

## 9.4 Transfer Learning with PyTorch

### 9.4.1 Using Pre-trained Models
- **Description**: Transfer learning involves using a pre-trained model on a new task, often with a small amount of new data. This is possible due to the model's ability to extract relevant features learned from a larger dataset.
- **Significance**:
  - Reduces training time and computational resources.
  - Often results in better performance with limited data.
- **Usage**: Utilizing models like VGG16, ResNet, etc., from torchvision.models.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  import torch
  import torch.nn as nn
  from torchvision import models, transforms
  from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, Dataset

  # Load a pre-trained ResNet model
  resnet = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)

  # Freeze the layers of the base model
  for param in resnet.parameters():
      param.requires_grad = False

  # Replace the final fully connected layer
  num_ftrs = resnet.fc.in_features
  resnet.fc = nn.Linear(num_ftrs, 2)

  # Example of data preparation and model training goes here
  ```

### 9.4.2 Fine-tuning Models
- **Description**: Fine-tuning involves unfreezing some of the layers of the pre-trained model and training them along with the added custom layers. This can improve performance by allowing the model to adapt more closely to the new data.
- **Significance**:
  - Allows the model to fine-tune its weights specifically for the new task.
- **Usage**: Carefully selecting which layers to unfreeze and retrain.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  import torch
  import torch.nn as nn
  from torchvision import models, transforms
  from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, Dataset

  # Load a pre-trained ResNet model
  resnet = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)

  # Freeze the initial layers of the base model
  for param in resnet.parameters():
      param.requires_grad = False

  # Unfreeze the layers from layer4 onwards
  for param in resnet.layer4.parameters():
      param.requires_grad = True

  # Replace the final fully connected layer
  num_ftrs = resnet.fc.in_features
  resnet.fc = nn.Linear(num_ftrs, 2)

  # Example of data preparation and model training goes here
  ```
