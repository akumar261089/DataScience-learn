# Chapter 1: Introduction to Machine Learning

## 1.1 What is Machine Learning?

### 1.1.1 Definition and Scope of Machine Learning
- **Definition**: Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing algorithms that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

- **Scope**:
  - **Data-driven Decisions**: ML enables systems to analyze vast amounts of data and make predictive decisions.
  - **Automation**: Automates tasks like classification, anomaly detection, clustering, prediction, etc.
  - **Continuous Improvement**: Systems improve their performance over time as they are exposed to more data.

### 1.1.2 Differences between AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**:
  - Definition: The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.
  - Scope: Encompasses various domains, including ML, natural language processing, robotics, and computer vision.
  
- **Machine Learning (ML)**:
  - Definition: A subset of AI focusing on building systems that learn from and make decisions based on data.
  - Scope: Involves algorithms like regression, classification, clustering, etc.

- **Deep Learning (DL)**:
  - Definition: A subset of ML involving neural networks with many layers (deep neural networks) that can learn complex patterns in data.
  - Scope: High complexity, often require large datasets and computational power. Commonly used in image recognition, natural language processing, and more.

## 1.2 Types of Machine Learning

- **Definition**: An unsupervised learning task where the goal is to reduce the number of input variables while preserving the essential patterns in the data.
- **Examples**:
  - Visualizing high-dimensional data
  - Reducing noise in the data
- **Algorithms**:
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  - t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
  - Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Explained Variance Ratio

### 1.2.3 Reinforcement Learning
- **Definition**: A type of ML where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Agent**: The learner or decision-maker.
  - **Environment**: The external system the agent interacts with.
  - **State**: A representation of the current situation of the agent.
  - **Action**: The decisions or moves taken by the agent.
  - **Reward**: The feedback from the environment as a result of the actions taken.
- **Examples**:
  - Game playing (e.g., AlphaGo)
