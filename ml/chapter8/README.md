## 8.4 Transfer Learning

### 8.4.1 Using Pre-trained Models
- **Description**: Transfer learning involves using a pre-trained model on a new task, often with a small amount of new data. This is possible due to the model's ability to extract relevant features learned from a larger dataset.
- **Significance**:
  - Reduces training time and computational resources.
  - Often results in better performance with limited data.
- **Usage**: Utilizing models like VGG16, ResNet, etc., from TensorFlow Hub or Keras Applications.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  import tensorflow as tf
  from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG16
  from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
  from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Flatten

  # Load the VGG16 model pre-trained on ImageNet
  base_model = VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))

  # Add custom layers on top of the base model
  x = base_model.output
  x = Flatten()(x)
  x = Dense(1024, activation='relu')(x)
  predictions = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x)

  # Define the complete model
  model = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=predictions)

  # Freeze the layers of the base model
  for layer in base_model.layers:
      layer.trainable = False

  # Compile the model
  model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

  # Example data preparation and model training would go here
  ```

### 8.4.2 Fine-tuning Models
- **Description**: Fine-tuning involves unfreezing some of the layers of the pre-trained model and training them along with the added custom layers. This can improve performance by allowing the model to adapt more closely to the new data.
- **Significance**:
  - Allows the model to fine-tune its weights specifically for the new task.
- **Usage**: Carefully selecting which layers to unfreeze and retrain.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  import tensorflow as tf
  from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG16
  from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
  from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Flatten

  # Load the VGG16 model pre-trained on ImageNet
  base_model = VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))

  # Add custom layers on top of the base model
  x = base_model.output
  x = Flatten()(x)
  x = Dense(1024, activation='relu')(x)
  predictions = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x)

  # Define the complete model
  model = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=predictions)

  # Freeze the initial layers of the base model (e.g., first 15 layers)
  for layer in base_model.layers[:15]:
      layer.trainable = False

  # Compile the model
  model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

  # Example data preparation and model training would go here
  ```
