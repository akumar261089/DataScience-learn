# Chapter 9: Transformer Models

## 9.1 Attention Mechanism

### Understanding Attention Mechanism
The attention mechanism is a technique in neural networks that enables the model to selectively focus on important parts of the input sequence when producing the output. It was introduced to improve the performance of neural machine translation and other tasks involving sequence-to-sequence models.

#### Theory
The core idea of the attention mechanism is to compute a weighted sum of all input vectors where the weights are dynamically computed based on their relevance to the current output vector. This allows the model to focus on parts of the input sequence that are more relevant to the current context.

The general steps to compute attention weights are as follows:
1. **Compute the alignment score**: This measures the similarity between the current hidden state and each input vector. For example, the dot product can be used as the alignment score.
2. **Apply the softmax function**: Convert the alignment scores into probabilities (weights) that sum to 1. This helps in focusing on important parts while disregarding less important ones.
3. **Compute the context vector**: This is the weighted sum of the input vectors using the computed attention weights.

\[ \text{score}(h_t, h_s) = h_t^T W_a h_s \]
\[ \alpha_{ts} = \frac{exp(\text{score}(h_t, h_s))}{\sum_{s=1}^{T_x} exp(\text{score}(h_t, h_s))} \]
\[ c_t = \sum_{s=1}^{T_x} \alpha_{ts} h_s \]

### Self-Attention
Self-attention (or intra-attention) is a mechanism allowing the model to attend to different positions of the same sequence. It produces new representations of the sequence, taking into account the entire context. Self-attention is central to transformer models.

#### Theory
The self-attention mechanism involves three main steps: computing queries, keys, and values from the input sequence, then computing weighted sums of the values to generate the output.

1. **Compute Queries (Q), Keys (K), and Values (V)**: Each input vector is transformed into a query, key, and value vector using learned weight matrices.
\[ Q = XW^Q \]
\[ K = XW^K \]
\[ V = XW^V \]

2. **Compute Attention Scores**: Use the dot product of the query and key vectors to get attention scores, then apply softmax.
\[ \text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right) V \]

3. **Compute Weighted Sums**: The softmax scores are used to compute a weighted sum of the values.

### Coding Example of Self-Attention

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def scaled_dot_product_attention(Q, K, V, mask=None):
    matmul_qk = tf.matmul(Q, K, transpose_b=True)
    dk = tf.cast(tf.shape(K)[-1], tf.float32)
    scaled_attention_logits = matmul_qk / tf.math.sqrt(dk)

    if mask is not None:
        scaled_attention_logits += (mask * -1e9)

    attention_weights = tf.nn.softmax(scaled_attention_logits 
    (axis=-1)
    output = tf.matmul(attention_weights, V)
    return output, attention_weights

# Example usage
def create_data_sequence(seq_len, d_model):
    X = tf.random.uniform((1, seq_len, d_model))
    return X

seq_len, d_model = 10, 64
X = create_data_sequence(seq_len, d_model)

Q = tf.keras.layers.Dense(d_model)(X)
K = tf.keras.layers.Dense(d_model)(X)
V = tf.keras.layers.Dense(d_model)(X)

output, attention_weights = scaled_dot_product_attention(Q, K, V)
print("Attention weights:", attention_weights)
print("Output:", output)
```

## 9.2 Introduction to Transformer Architecture

### Understanding the Transformer Architecture
The Transformer model, introduced in the paper "Attention Is All You Need" by Vaswani et al., is a deep learning model that relies exclusively on self-attention mechanisms and eliminates the sequential nature present in RNNs and LSTMs. It allows for much more parallelization and improves training efficiency for large datasets.

#### Encoder-Decoder Structure
The Transformer model consists of two main parts: the encoder and the decoder. Each of these parts contains multiple layers, and each layer consists of two main components: a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a position-wise fully connected feed-forward network.

1. **Encoder**: Processes the input sequence into a sequence of continuous representations.
    - **Input Embedding**: Converts input tokens into vectors of fixed size.
    - **Positional Encoding**: Adds information about the position of tokens in the sequence since the model is position-agnostic.
    - **Stacked Layers**: Multiple identical layers, each containing:
      - **Multi-Head Self-Attention**: Allows the model to jointly attend to information at different positions.
      - **Feed-Forward Neural Network**: Applied to each position separately and identically.
      - **Residual Connections**: Enhances the flow of gradients during training.

2. **Decoder**: Generates the output sequence from the encoded input sequence.
    - **Output Embedding**: Converts output tokens into vectors.
    - **Positional Encoding**: Adds positional information to the sequences.
    - **Stacked Layers**: Multiple identical layers, each containing:
      - **Masked Multi-Head Self-Attention**: Prevents attending to future tokens in the sequence.
      - **Multi-Head Attention with Encoded Input**: Attends to both the encoder outputs and current decoder position.
      - **Feed-Forward Neural Network**: Applied to each position separately and identically.
      - **Residual Connections**: Enhances the flow of gradients during training.

#### Code Example of Basic Transformer Block

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, LayerNormalization, Dropout

class MultiHeadSelfAttention(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, d_model, num_heads):
        super(MultiHeadSelfAttention, self).__init__()
        self.num_heads = num_heads
        self.d_model = d_model

        assert d_model % self.num_heads == 0

        self.depth = d_model // self.num_heads

        self.wq = Dense(d_model)
        self.wk = Dense(d_model)
        self.wv = Dense(d_model)

        self.dense = Dense(d_model)

    def split_heads(self, x, batch_size):
        x = tf.reshape(x, (batch_size, -1, self.num_heads, self.depth))
        return
        ```
        tf.transpose(x, perm=[0, 2, 1, 3])

    def call(self, v, k, q, mask):
        batch_size = tf.shape(q)[0]

        q = self.wq(q)
        k = self.wk(k)
        v = self.wv(v)

        q = self.split_heads(q, batch_size)
        k = self.split_heads(k, batch_size)
        v = self.split_heads(v, batch_size)

        scaled_attention, attention_weights = scaled_dot_product_attention(q, k, v, mask)

        scaled_attention = tf.transpose(scaled_attention, perm=[0, 2, 1, 3])
        concat_attention = tf.reshape(scaled_attention, (batch_size, -1, self.d_model))
        output = self.dense(concat_attention)

        return output, attention_weights

class TransformerBlock(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, d_model, num_heads, dff, rate=0.1):
        super(TransformerBlock, self).__init__()

        self.mha = MultiHeadSelfAttention(d_model, num_heads)
        self.ffn = tf.keras.Sequential([
            Dense(dff, activation='relu'),
            Dense(d_model)
        ])

        self.layernorm1 = LayerNormalization(epsilon=1e-6)
        self.layernorm2 = LayerNormalization(epsilon=1e-6)

        self.dropout1 = Dropout(rate)
        self.dropout2 = Dropout(rate)

    def call(self, x, training, mask):
        attn_output, _ = self.mha(x, x, x, mask)
        attn_output = self.dropout1(attn_output, training=training)
        out1 = self.layernorm1(x + attn_output)

        ffn_output = self.ffn(out1)
        ffn_output = self.dropout2(ffn_output, training=training)
        out2 = self.layernorm2(out1 + ffn_output)

        return out2
```

## 9.3 Implementing Transformers 

### Using Hugging Face's Transformers Library

Hugging Face provides a comprehensive library called `transformers`, which simplifies the usage and implementation of transformer models such as BERT, GPT, and others.

#### Example: Using Pre-trained BERT with Hugging Face

```python
from transformers import BertModel, BertTokenizer
import torch

# Load pre-trained model and tokenizer
model_name = "bert-base-uncased"
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = BertModel.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Example sentence
text = "Transformers are amazing for NLP tasks!"

# Tokenize input
inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt")

# Forward pass through BERT model
outputs = model(**inputs)

# Extract last hidden states
last_hidden_states = outputs.last_hidden_state
print(last_hidden_states)
```

### Significance and Use Cases
- **Text Classification**: Fine-tuning pre-trained models for sentiment analysis, spam detection, etc.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying entities in a text such as names, dates, locations.
- **Question Answering**: Models like BERT can be fine-tuned on QA datasets to provide accurate answers.
- **Machine Translation and Summarization**: Advanced models such as T5 and GPT-3 can be used for translating languages and summarizing lengthy articles efficiently.

## 9.4 BERT and its Variants

### Understanding BERT
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) introduced by Google, leverages transformers to build powerful language models by training on large corpora in a bid irectional fashion. Unlike traditional left-to-right or right-to-left language models, BERT uses both left and right contexts to understand the meaning of a word within a sentence. This enables BERT to capture the meaning more accurately.

#### Theory
BERT involves the following key components and innovations:
- **Pre-training**: BERT is pre-trained on two unsupervised tasks:
  - **Masked Language Model (MLM)**: Randomly masks some of the tokens in the input and trains the model to predict those masked tokens.
  - **Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)**: Trains the model to understand the relationship between two sentences by predicting whether a given sentence B follows sentence A.
- **Fine-tuning**: Once pre-trained, BERT can be fine-tuned on specific downstream tasks (e.g., text classification, question answering) by adding a simple classification layer on top of the pre-trained model.

### Fine-tuning BERT for Specific Tasks

#### Example: Fine-tuning BERT for Text Classification

```python
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification, Trainer, TrainingArguments
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader

class CustomDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, texts, labels, tokenizer, max_len):
        self.texts = texts
        self.labels = labels
        self.tokenizer = tokenizer
        self.max_len = max_len

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.texts)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        text = self.texts[idx]
        label = self.labels[idx]
        encoding = self.tokenizer.encode_plus(
            text,
            add_special_tokens=True,
            max_length=self.max_len,
            return_token_type_ids=False,
            padding='max_length',
            truncation=True,
            return_attention_mask=True,
            return_tensors='pt',
        )
        return {
            'text': text,
            'input_ids': encoding['input_ids'].flatten(),
            'attention_mask': encoding['attention_mask'].flatten(),
            'labels': torch.tensor(label, dtype=torch.long)
        }

# Sample data
texts = ["I love programming.", "Transformers are amazing!", "Deep learning is fun."]
labels = [1, 1, 0]  # Example labels

# Load pre-trained BERT tokenizer and model
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased', num_labels=2)

# Create dataset and dataloader
max_len = 64
dataset = CustomDataset(texts, labels, tokenizer, max_len)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=2)

# Define training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir='./results',
    num_train_epochs=3,
    per_device_train_batch_size=2,
    warm_up_steps=10,
    weight_decay=0.01,
    logging_dir='./logs',
    logging_steps=10,
)

# Trainer class for fine-tuning
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=dataset,
)

# Fine-tune the model
trainer.train()
```

### Significance and Use Cases of BERT
- **Text Classification**: Fine-tuning BERT for sentiment analysis, spam detection, and more.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: BERT can be fine-tuned on NER tasks to identify entities in texts.
- **Question Answering**: BERT excels in question-answering tasks, providing relevant answers to posed questions.
- **Semantic Similarity**: BERT can determine how similar two pieces of text are, which is useful in various NLP tasks like text summarization and information retrieval.

#### Variants of BERT
- **RoBERTa (Robustly optimized BERT approach)**: An optimized version of BERT with large-scale settings and longer training processes.
- **DistilBERT**: A smaller, faster, cheaper, and lighter version of BERT, which retains most of BERT's capabilities.
- **ALBERT (A Lite BERT)**: Reduces the parameters of BERT for faster training times and efficiency, without significant loss in performance.

## Conclusion
