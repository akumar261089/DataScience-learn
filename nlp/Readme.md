## ðŸ“¦ Python Libraries

In this section, you will find details about key Python libraries used in this course, along with examples for each.

### nltk
#### Overview
nltk (Natural Language Toolkit) is a powerful library for working with human language data in Python.

#### Installation
```bash
pip install nltk
```

#### Examples
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

text = "Natural Language Processing with Python is fun!"
tokens = word_tokenize(text)
print(tokens)
```

### spaCy

spaCy is an open-source library for advanced NLP with Python, designed for efficiency.

#### Installation
```bash
pip install spacy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

#### Examples
```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
doc = nlp("Natural Language Processing with Python is fun!")
for token in doc:
    print(token.text, token.pos_, token.dep_)
```
