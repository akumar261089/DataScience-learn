# **Python Tutorial: Objects and Classes**

## 1. **Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into **objects** and **classes**. An object is an instance of a class, and a class is a blueprint for creating objects. OOP is centered around the following concepts:

- **Classes**: Define the structure and behaviors of objects.
- **Objects**: Instances of classes that contain data (attributes) and methods (functions).
- **Attributes**: Variables that belong to a class or an object.
- **Methods**: Functions that belong to a class or an object.
- **Inheritance**: A mechanism where a new class inherits attributes and methods from an existing class.
- **Encapsulation**: Restricting access to certain parts of an object’s data.
- **Polymorphism**: The ability to use a single interface to represent different data types.

## 2. **Creating Classes and Objects**

### 2.1 **Defining a Class**

In Python, classes are defined using the `class` keyword. A class can have attributes (variables) and methods (functions).

```python
class Dog:
    # Constructor method to initialize attributes
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name  # Instance attribute
        self.age = age    # Instance attribute

    # Method of the class
    def bark(self):
        print(f"{self.name} says Woof!")

# Creating an object (instance) of the class
my_dog = Dog("Buddy", 3)

# Accessing object attributes
print(my_dog.name)  # Output: Buddy
print(my_dog.age)   # Output: 3

# Calling an object method
my_dog.bark()  # Output: Buddy says Woof!
```

### 2.2 **Explanation:**
- The `class` keyword is used to define a class.
- The `__init__` method is the constructor method that initializes the object’s attributes. It is automatically called when an object is created.
- `self` refers to the current instance of the class (the object itself).
- To create an object, you call the class like a function (`my_dog = Dog("Buddy", 3)`).
- Access attributes using dot notation (`my_dog.name`).
- Call methods using dot notation (`my_dog.bark()`).

### 2.3 **Exercise:**
Create a class `Car` with the following attributes: `make`, `model`, and `year`. It should have a method `display_info` that prints the car’s details.

## 3. **Instance vs. Class Attributes**

### 3.1 **Instance Attributes**

Instance attributes are specific to an instance (object) of a class. They are defined within the `__init__` method and can be accessed using the `self` keyword.

```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, grade):
        self.name = name  # Instance attribute
        self.grade = grade  # Instance attribute

# Creating an object
student1 = Student("Alice", "A")

# Accessing instance attributes
print(student1.name)  # Output: Alice
print(student1.grade)  # Output: A
```

### 3.2 **Class Attributes**

Class attributes are shared across all instances of the class. They are defined directly inside the class, outside of the `__init__` method.

```python
class School:
    school_name = "Greenwood High"  # Class attribute

    def __init__(self, student_name):
        self.student_name = student_name  # Instance attribute

# Creating objects
student1 = School("Alice")
student2 = School("Bob")

# Accessing class attribute
print(School.school_name)  # Output: Greenwood High

# Accessing instance attribute
print(student1.student_name)  # Output: Alice
```

### 3.3 **Difference Between Instance and Class Attributes**

- **Instance attributes** are specific to each object, meaning different objects can have different values for the same attribute.
- **Class attributes** are shared among all instances of the class, so they have the same value across all objects of the class.

## 4. **Methods in Classes**

### 4.1 **Instance Methods**

Instance methods are functions defined inside a class that take `self` as the first parameter, which refers to the instance of the class.

```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

    def area(self):
        return self.width * self.height

# Creating an object
rect = Rectangle(4, 5)

# Calling the instance method
print(rect.area())  # Output: 20
```

### 4.2 **Class Methods**

Class methods are defined with the `@classmethod` decorator and take `cls` (class) as the first argument instead of `self`.

```python
class Vehicle:
    num_wheels = 4

    @classmethod
    def number_of_wheels(cls):
        return cls.num_wheels

# Calling the class method
print(Vehicle.number_of_wheels())  # Output: 4
```

### 4.3 **Static Methods**

Static methods don’t operate on an instance or the class, and they are defined with the `@staticmethod` decorator. They don’t require `self` or `cls` as the first parameter.

```python
class Math:
    @staticmethod
    def add(a, b):
        return a + b

# Calling the static method
print(Math.add(3, 5))  # Output: 8
```

### 4.4 **Exercise:**
Create a `Person` class with the following:
- Instance attributes: `name`, `age`
- Class method: `class_description` that returns the description of the class.
- Static method: `is_adult` that takes age as input and returns True if the age is 18 or greater.

## 5. **Inheritance in Python**

Inheritance allows one class to inherit the attributes and methods of another class, promoting code reusability.

### 5.1 **Basic Inheritance**

In inheritance, the class that is inherited from is called the **parent class**, and the class that inherits is the **child class**.

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def speak(self):
        print("Animal speaks")

class Dog(Animal):  # Dog inherits from Animal
    def speak(self):
        print(f"{self.name} says Woof!")

# Creating a Dog object
dog = Dog("Buddy")
dog.speak()  # Output: Buddy says Woof!
```

### 5.2 **Overriding Methods**

Child classes can override methods of the parent class to provide their own implementation.

```python
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        print("Animal speaks")

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print("Woof!")

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print("Meow!")

# Creating objects
dog = Dog()
cat = Cat()

# Calling overridden methods
dog.speak()  # Output: Woof!
cat.speak()  # Output: Meow!
```

### 5.3 **Using `super()` in Inheritance**

The `super()` function allows you to call methods from the parent class, typically used in the child class’s `__init__` method.

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

class Dog(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        super().__init__(name)  # Call parent class's __init__
        self.breed = breed

# Creating an object
dog = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever")
print(dog.name)   # Output: Buddy
print(dog.breed)  # Output: Golden Retriever
```

### 5.4 **Exercise:**
Create a class `Car` with a method `start_engine`. Create a subclass `ElectricCar` that inherits from `Car` and overrides the `start_engine` method to print a message like "Starting electric motor".

---

## 6. **Polymorphism**

Polymorphism allows methods to behave differently based on the object calling them, even if they have the same name.

### 6.1 **Polymorphism with Method Overriding**

```python
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        print("Animal speaks")

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print("Woof!")

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print("Meow!")

# Polymorphism in action
animals = [Dog(), Cat()]

for animal in animals:
    animal.speak()  # Output: Woof! Meow!
```

### 6.2 **Polymorphism with `super()`**

You can combine polymorphism with inheritance to call a method from the parent class in the child class.

```python
class Shape:
    def area(self):
        pass  # Placeholder method

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

    def area(self):
        return self.width * self.height

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
       

 return 3.14 * (self.radius ** 2)

# Polymorphism with different shapes
shapes = [Rectangle(4, 5), Circle(3)]

for shape in shapes:
    print(shape.area())  # Output: 20.0 28.26
```

---

## 7. **Encapsulation**

Encapsulation involves hiding the internal state of an object and exposing only necessary functionality.

### 7.1 **Private Attributes**

In Python, private attributes can be defined by prefixing them with two underscores (`__`).

```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.__balance = balance  # Private attribute

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.__balance += amount

    def get_balance(self):
        return self.__balance

# Creating an object
account = BankAccount(100)

# Accessing private attribute directly will raise an error
# print(account.__balance)  # AttributeError

# Using public method to access private attribute
print(account.get_balance())  # Output: 100
```

### 7.2 **Getter and Setter Methods**

You can define getter and setter methods to control access to private attributes.

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.__name = name

    def get_name(self):
        return self.__name

    def set_name(self, name):
        self.__name = name

# Creating an object
person = Person("Alice")
print(person.get_name())  # Output: Alice

person.set_name("Bob")
print(person.get_name())  # Output: Bob
```

## Conclusion

- **Classes** and **Objects** are fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). Classes are blueprints, and objects are instances of those blueprints.
- **Methods** define the behavior of objects, and **attributes** define their state.
- **Inheritance** allows one class to inherit behavior from another, enabling code reuse.
- **Polymorphism** lets you define methods that can have different implementations for different classes.
- **Encapsulation** helps in protecting the internal state of an object from unauthorized access.

OOP is a powerful paradigm that allows you to model real-world entities and relationships in your code, making it more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.
