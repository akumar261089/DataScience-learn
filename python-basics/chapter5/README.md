# **Python Tutorial: Files, Pandas, and NumPy**

## **1. Working with Files in Python**

In Python, working with files is an essential part of data handling, whether you are reading data from text files, CSV files, or writing output to files. This section covers how to handle text files using built-in functions and libraries.

### 1.1 **Reading Files**

To read a file, Python provides built-in functions like `open()` that allow you to access and manipulate file contents.

#### Basic File Reading:
```python
# Open a file in read mode ('r')
file = open('example.txt', 'r')

# Read the entire content of the file
content = file.read()
print(content)

# Close the file when done
file.close()
```

#### Reading Line by Line:
```python
# Open the file in read mode
file = open('example.txt', 'r')

# Read file line by line
for line in file:
    print(line.strip())  # strip() to remove the newline character

file.close()
```

#### Using `with` Statement (Recommended):
The `with` statement automatically closes the file after the block of code is executed, which is a better practice to avoid leaving files open.

```python
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

### 1.2 **Writing to Files**

You can also write data to a file using the `open()` function with the write (`'w'`) or append (`'a'`) mode.

#### Writing to a File:
```python
with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write("Hello, world!\n")
    file.write("Writing to a file in Python.")
```

#### Appending to a File:
```python
with open('output.txt', 'a') as file:
    file.write("\nThis line is appended.")
```

### 1.3 **Reading CSV Files**

Python provides the `csv` module for reading and writing CSV files.

```python
import csv

# Reading a CSV file
with open('data.csv', mode='r') as file:
    csv_reader = csv.reader(file)
    for row in csv_reader:
        print(row)
```

### 1.4 **Writing CSV Files**

```python
import csv

data = [
    ["Name", "Age", "City"],
    ["Alice", 25, "New York"],
    ["Bob", 30, "San Francisco"],
    ["Charlie", 35, "London"]
]

with open('output.csv', mode='w', newline='') as file:
    csv_writer = csv.writer(file)
    csv_writer.writerows(data)
```

## **2. Pandas: Data Analysis and Manipulation**

Pandas is one of the most powerful Python libraries for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures like Series and DataFrames that allow easy handling of structured data.

### 2.1 **Installing Pandas**

If you donâ€™t have Pandas installed, you can install it using:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

### 2.2 **Introduction to DataFrames**

A **DataFrame** is a 2-dimensional, size-mutable, and potentially heterogeneous tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns).

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame from a dictionary
data = {
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
    'Age': [25, 30, 35],
    'City': ['New York', 'San Francisco', 'London']
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
```

**Output:**
```
       Name  Age           City
0     Alice   25       New York
1       Bob   30  San Francisco
2  Charlie   35         London
```

### 2.3 **Reading Data from CSV Files**

You can easily read data from CSV files into a Pandas DataFrame using `pd.read_csv()`.

```python
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
print(df)
```

### 2.4 **Basic DataFrame Operations**

#### Accessing Columns:
```python
# Access a single column
print(df['Name'])

# Access multiple columns
print(df[['Name', 'Age']])
```

#### Accessing Rows:
```python
# Access a single row by index
print(df.iloc[0])  # First row

# Access rows by condition
print(df[df['Age'] > 30])
```

#### Selecting Rows and Columns:
```python
# Select row by index and column by column label
print(df.loc[1, 'City'])  # Row 1, Column 'City'
```

#### Adding New Columns:
```python
df['Country'] = ['USA', 'USA', 'UK']
print(df)
```

### 2.5 **Data Cleaning**

Pandas provides methods to clean and preprocess data.

#### Handling Missing Data:
```python
# Fill missing values with a specific value
df['Age'].fillna(df['Age'].mean(), inplace=True)

# Drop rows with missing values
df.dropna(inplace=True)
```

#### Renaming Columns:
```python
df.rename(columns={'Name': 'Full Name'}, inplace=True)
print(df)
```

### 2.6 **GroupBy and Aggregation**

The `groupby()` method is useful for grouping data and applying aggregation functions.

```python
# Grouping by a column and calculating the mean
grouped = df.groupby('City')['Age'].mean()
print(grouped)
```

### 2.7 **Sorting Data**

You can sort a DataFrame by one or more columns.

```python
df.sort_values(by='Age', ascending=False, inplace=True)
print(df)
```

### 2.8 **Saving DataFrames to CSV**

```python
df.to_csv('output.csv', index=False)
```

### 2.9 **Exercise:**

Load a CSV file with information about products (e.g., name, price, quantity), clean the data, and calculate the total value (price * quantity) for each product.

## **3. NumPy: Numerical Computing with Arrays**

NumPy is a core scientific computing library in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and many mathematical functions.

### 3.1 **Installing NumPy**

If you don't have NumPy installed, you can install it via:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

### 3.2 **Creating NumPy Arrays**

NumPy arrays are more efficient than lists and provide a lot of functionality for scientific computation.

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a NumPy array from a list
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(arr)
```

#### Creating Arrays with Specific Values:
```python
# Create an array of zeros
zeros_arr = np.zeros(5)
print(zeros_arr)

# Create an array of ones
ones_arr = np.ones(5)
print(ones_arr)

# Create an array with values spaced evenly within a specified interval
range_arr = np.linspace(0, 10, 5)  # 5 values between 0 and 10
print(range_arr)
```

### 3.3 **Array Dimensions**

NumPy supports multi-dimensional arrays.

```python
# Create a 2D array (matrix)
matrix = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
print(matrix)

# Check the shape of the array (rows, columns)
print(matrix.shape)
```

### 3.4 **Array Indexing and Slicing**

NumPy allows efficient indexing and slicing of arrays.

```python
# Accessing elements
print(arr[2])  # Output: 3

# Slicing arrays
print(arr[1:4])  # Output: [2, 3, 4]

# Multi-dimensional slicing
print(matrix[1:, :])  # Select rows 1 and 2, all columns
```

### 3.5 **Mathematical Operations with NumPy**

NumPy allows efficient element-wise operations on arrays.

```python
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Element-wise operations
print(arr + 10)  # Add 10 to each element
print(arr * 2)   # Multiply each element by 2
print(arr ** 2)  # Square each element
```

### 3.6 **Array Aggregations**

NumPy provides a number of aggregation functions like `sum()`, `mean()`, `max()`, etc.

```python
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Sum of elements
print(np.sum(arr))  # Output: 15

# Mean of elements
print(np.mean(arr))  # Output: 3.0

# Max and Min of elements
print(np.max(arr))  # Output: 5
print(np.min(arr))  # Output: 1
```

### 3.7 **Broadcasting**

NumPy arrays support broadcasting, which allows you to perform operations on arrays of different shapes.

```python
arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])

# Broadcasting addition
result = arr1 + arr2  # Output: [5, 7, 9]
print(result)
```

### 3.8 **Linear Algebra Operations**

NumPy also provides methods for

 linear algebra operations.

```python
# Matrix multiplication
A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
B = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
result = np.dot(A, B)
print(result)

# Finding the determinant of a matrix
det = np.linalg.det(A)
print(det)
```

### 3.9 **Exercise:**

Create a NumPy array with random numbers between 0 and 100. Reshape it into a 5x5 matrix. Find the mean, maximum, and sum of the entire matrix, as well as the sum along each row.
